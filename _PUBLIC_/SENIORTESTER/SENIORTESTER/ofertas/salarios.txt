I think "Senior Tester" means the experience of working in different projects, that use different technologies. That means the tester has faced to various situations and problems that arise during development process, and most likely knows how to resolve them, is able to figure out the most effective solution. So, it' s not about definite amount of years worked in testing, is rather about experience itself. Also I think senior tester should be able to teach junior testers, to lead.
